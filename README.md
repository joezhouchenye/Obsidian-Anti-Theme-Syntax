# Obsidian-Anti-Theme-Syntax
An Obsidian CSS collection for advanced Markdown syntax.

Many popular themes like Blue Topaz or Minimal add their own special markdown syntax support. This is annoying as it limits your freedom to switch to other themes.

As a result, I create this repository to include useful special markdown syntax support CSS files.
